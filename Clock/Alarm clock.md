# Alarm Clock Program

This Python program implements a graphical alarm clock using the Tkinter library. The program displays a digital clock and allows users to set an alarm time. When the set alarm time is reached, the program plays a sound.

## Features

-  Digital Clock Display:  The program displays a digital clock with the current time, date, day of the week, timezone, and timezone abbreviation.

-  Alarm Setting:  Users can set an alarm in a 24-hour format using the provided Entry fields.

-  Alarm Sound:  When the current time matches the set alarm time, the program plays a sound ("Music.wav").

## Usage

1.  Requirements:  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2.  Dependencies:  The program uses the Tkinter library for the GUI, time for handling time-related operations, and winsound for playing the alarm sound.

3.  Run the Program: 
   ```bash
   python alarm_clock.py
   ```

4.  Set Alarm: 
   - Enter the desired hour, minute, and second in the respective Entry fields.
   - Click the "Set Your Alarm" button.

5.  Note: 
   - The time must be entered in the 24-hour format.
   - The program will continue running in the background until the alarm is triggered.

## Code Explanation

### `Clock` Class
- Initializes a digital clock using Tkinter's Label widget.
- Updates the clock display every second using the `time` method.

### `AlarmClock` Class (Inherits from `Clock`)
- Extends the `Clock` class to include alarm functionality.
- Adds Entry fields for setting the alarm time and a button to trigger the alarm.
- Implements the `alarm_clock` method to continuously check for the alarm time match and play the sound.

### Main Execution
- Creates an instance of the `Tk` class.
- Instantiates the `AlarmClock` class, initializing the GUI.
- Starts the Tkinter event loop with `mainloop()`.
