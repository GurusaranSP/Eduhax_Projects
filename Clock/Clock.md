# Digital Clock Program

This Python program implements a graphical digital clock using the Tkinter library. The program displays the current time, date, day of the week, timezone, and timezone abbreviation.

## Features

-  Digital Clock Display:  The program displays a digital clock with the current time, date, day of the week, timezone, and timezone abbreviation.

## Usage

1.  Requirements:  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2.  Dependencies:  The program uses the Tkinter library for the GUI, time for handling time-related operations, and winsound for potential future enhancements (currently not utilized).

3.  Run the Program: 
   ```bash
   python digital_clock.py
   ```

4.  Note: 
   - The clock updates every second.

## Code Explanation

The program uses the `Tkinter` library to create a GUI window and display a digital clock. It utilizes the `strftime` function from the `time` module to format and update the clock's text every second.

### `time` Function
- Formats the current time, date, day of the week, timezone, and timezone abbreviation using `strftime`.
- Updates the clock display every second using the `after` method.

### Main Execution
- Creates an instance of the `Tk` class.
- Sets the window size using `grid_bbox`.
- Sets the window title to "Clock."
- Creates a `Label` widget (`clk`) for displaying the digital clock.
- Invokes the `time` function to start the clock update loop.
- Starts the Tkinter event loop with `mainloop()`.
