# Turtle Octagon Drawing Program

This Python program utilizes the Turtle graphics library to draw a pattern of nested octagons. The program sets up the Turtle window and draws nested octagons with an orange-red color on a black background.

## Features

-  Turtle Graphics:  The program utilizes the Turtle library to draw nested octagons.
-  Color and Background:  The Turtle draws octagons with an orange-red color on a black background.

## Usage

   ```

3.  Note: 
   - The Turtle window will display, and the Turtle will draw nested octagons.

## Code Explanation

The program uses the `turtle` library to create a Turtle and draw nested octagons on the screen. The `speed`, `bgcolor`, `color`, and `pensize` functions are used to set up the Turtle's appearance.

### Main Execution
- Sets the Turtle drawing speed to 5.
- Sets the background color of the Turtle window to black.
- Sets the Turtle pen color to orange-red and the pen size to 5.
- Iterates through two loops to draw nested octagons.
- Hides the Turtle and finishes the drawing.
