# Turtle Hexagon Drawing Program

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a pattern of nested hexagons. The program sets up the Turtle window and draws nested hexagons with a green-yellow color on a black background.

## Features

- **Turtle Graphics:** The program utilizes the Turtle library to draw nested hexagons.
- **Color and Background:** The Turtle draws hexagons with a green-yellow color on a black background.

## Usage

1. **Requirements:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Dependencies:** The program uses the `turtle` library.

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   python turtle_hexagon.py
   ```

4. **Note:**
   - The Turtle window will display, and the Turtle will draw nested hexagons.

## Code Explanation

The program uses the `turtle` library to create a Turtle and draw nested hexagons on the screen. The `speed`, `bgcolor`, `color`, and `pensize` functions are used to set up the Turtle's appearance.

### Main Execution
- Sets the Turtle drawing speed to 1.
- Sets the background color of the Turtle window to black.
- Sets the Turtle pen color to green-yellow and the pen size to 5.
- Iterates through two loops to draw nested hexagons.
- Hides the Turtle and finishes the drawing.

Feel free to customize the program to create different patterns or adjust the colors and sizes!
